What this means to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less cruft.  50MB less cruft to be exact.  Goodbye deadweight</li>\n<li>Speed improvements. LokiJs is an in-memory document store and it's fast</li>\n<li>Shorter install times</li>\n<li>No more mysterious errors.  Node-gyp compiled custom C/C++ code that was hard to debug and impossible to test on every environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better Web UI</li>\n<li>Updated Electron to version 1.6.15</li>\n<li>Fixed DB bug that would cause deleted files not to be removed from DB</li>\n<li>The Windows EXE is now signed</li>\n</ul>"
