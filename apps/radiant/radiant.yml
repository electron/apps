  'Radiant is a revolutionary network designed to solve the problems with all existing blockchains in terms of scale, parallelism and Turing Complete programming. Radiant is a peer-to-peer digital asset system that enables direct exchange of value without going through a central party. Similarly to Bitcoin, the Radiant network requires minimal structure, and timestamps transactions into an ongoing hash-based chain of proof-of-work (SHA512/256).'
