As per https://github.com/electron/apps/blob/master/contributing.md#company-logos-and-names --

If {{COMPANY}} has given you permission to use that name, please provide that information in the PR so that the app's name can be used as-is. Otherwise,

> Please do not directly use another company's name or product without permission. It's generally better to refer to it in a dependent clause; for example, after "compatible with", "on", or "for."
>
> For example, while we would not accept a third-party app named "GitHub Notifications", we would consider "Yourname Notifications for GitHub".
